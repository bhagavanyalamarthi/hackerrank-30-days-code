TASK
Write a Person class with an instance variable, age, and a constructor that takes an integer, initialAge, as a parameter. The constructor must assign initialAge to age after confirming the argument passed as initialAge is non negative; if a negative argument is passed as _initial_Age, the constructor should set age to 0 and print Age is not valid, setting age to 0.. In addition, you must write the following instance methods:

yearPasses() should increase the age instance variable by 1.
amIOld() should perform the following conditional actions:
If age < 13, print You are young.
If age ≥ 13 and _age < 18, print You are a teenager.
Otherwise, print You are old.
          CODE
          class Person:
    def __init__(self,initialAge):
     if initialAge < 0:
        print("Age is not valid, setting age to 0.")
        self.age = 0;
     else:
        self.age = initialAge  # Add some more code to run some checks on initialAge
    def amIOld(self):
     if self.age < 13:
            print("You are young.")
     elif self.age < 18:
            print("You are a teenager.")
     else:
            print("You are old.")
 # Do some computations in here and print out the correct statement to the console
    def yearPasses(self):
       self.age += 1 # Increment the age of the person in here

t = int(input())
for i in range(0, t):
    age = int(input())         
    p = Person(age)  
    p.amIOld()
    for j in range(0, 3):
        p.yearPasses()       
    p.amIOld()
    print("")
