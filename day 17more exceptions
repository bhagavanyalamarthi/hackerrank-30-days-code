Task
Write a Calculator class with a single method: int power(int, int). The power method takes two integers, n and p, as parameters and returns the integer result of n^p. If either n or p is negative, then the method must throw an exception must throw an exception with the message: n and p should be non-negative.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, T, the number of test cases. Each of the T subsequent lines describes a test case in 2 space-separated integers denoting n and p respectively.

Constraints
No test case will result in overflow for correctly written code.
Output Format
There are T lines of output, where each line contains the result of n^p as calculated by your Calculator class' power method.

    code
    class Calculator:
    def power(self, n, p):
        if n < 0 or p < 0 :
            raise Exception("n and p should be non-negative")
        else:
            return pow(n, p)




myCalculator=Calculator()
T=int(input())
for i in range(T):
    n,p = map(int, input().split())
    try:
        ans=myCalculator.power(n,p)
        print(ans)
    except Exception as e:
        print(e)
