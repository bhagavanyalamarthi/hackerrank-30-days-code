Task
You are given two classes, Person and Student, where Person is the base class and Student is the derived class. Completed code for Person and a declaration for Student are provided for you in the editor. Observe that Student inherits all the properties of _Person.

Complete the Student class by writing the following:

A Student class constructor, which has 4 parameters:
A string, firstName.
A string, lastName.
An integer, id.
An integer array (or vector) of test scores, scores.
A char_calculate() method that calculates a Student object's average and returns the grade character representative of their calculated average:
Grading Scale

Letter	Average(a)
O	90≤_a_≤100
E	80≤_a_<90
A	70≤_a_<80
P	55≤_a_<70
D	40≤_a_<55
T	a<40
Input Format
Read the following input from stdin: The first line contains firstName, lastName, and id, respectively. The second line contains the number of test scores. The third line of space-separated integers describes scores.

              CODE
              class Person:
	def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber):
		self.firstName = firstName
		self.lastName = lastName
		self.idNumber = idNumber
	def printPerson(self):
		print("Name:", self.lastName + ",", self.firstName)
		print("ID:", self.idNumber)


class Student(Person):
    # Class Constructor
    #
    #   Parameters:
    #   firstName - A string denoting the Person's first name.
    #   lastName - A string denoting the Person's last name.
    #   id - An integer denoting the Person's ID number.
    #   scores - An array of integers denoting the Person's test scores.
    def __init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber, scores):
        Person.__init__(self, firstName, lastName, idNumber)
        self.scores = scores

    #   Function Name: calculate
    #   Return: A character denoting the grade.
    def calculate(self):
        sum=0
        for score in scores:
            sum += score
        average = sum/len(scores)
        if average < 40:
            return 'T'
        elif average < 55:
            return 'D'
        elif average < 70:
            return 'P'
        elif average < 80:
            return 'A'
        elif average < 90:
            return 'E'
        else:
            return 'O'

line = input().split()
firstName = line[0]
lastName = line[1]
idNum = line[2]
numScores = int(input()) # not needed for Python
scores = list( map(int, input().split()) )
s = Student(firstName, lastName, idNum, scores)
s.printPerson()
print("Grade:", s.calculate())
