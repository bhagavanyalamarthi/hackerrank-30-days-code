Task complete teh Difference class by writing the following:
A class constructor that takes an array of integers as a parameter and saves it tot he elements instance variable.
A computeDifference method that finds the maximum absolute difference between any 2 numbers in N and stores it in the maximumDifference instance variable.
Input Format
The Solution class read in 2 lines of input; the first line contains N, and the second line describes the elements array.

              CODE
              class Difference:
    def __init__(self, a):
        self.__elements = a
        self.maximumDifference = 0

    def computeDifference(self):
        min_element = 101
        max_element = 0
        for element in self.__elements:
            if element < min_element:
                min_element = element
            if element > max_element:
                max_element = element

        self.maximumDifference = max_element - min_element


# End of Difference class

_ = input()
a = [int(e) for e in input().split(' ')]

d = Difference(a)
d.computeDifference()

print(d.maximumDifference)
