Task
Given an array, a, of size n distinct elements, sort the array in ascending order using the Bubble Sort algorithm above. Once sorted, print the following 3 lines:

Array is sorted in numSwaps swaps. where numSwaps is the number of swaps that took place.
First Element: firstElement where firstElement is the first element in the sorted array.
Last Element: lastElement where lastElement is the last element in the sorted array.
Hint: To complete this challenge, you will need to add a variable that keeps a running tally of all swaps that occur during execution.

Input Format
The first line contains an integer, n, denoting the number of elements in array a. The second line contains n space-separated integers describing the respective values of elements of a.



CODE

#!/bin/python3

import sys

n = int(input().strip())
a = list(map(int, input().strip().split(' ')))

numSwaps = 0
for i in range(n):
    currentSwaps = 0
    for j in range(n-1):
        if a[j] > a[j+1]:
            tmp = a[j]
            a[j] = a[j+1]
            a[j+1] = tmp
            numSwaps += 1
            currentSwaps += 1

    if currentSwaps == 0:
        break

print('Array is sorted in ' + str(numSwaps) + ' swaps.')
print('First Element: ' + str(a[0]))
print('Last Element: ' + str(a[n-1]))
